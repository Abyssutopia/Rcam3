# Rcam3

**Rcam3** is a real-time VFX project that utilizes the iPhone LiDAR sensor and Unity VFX Graph.

Rcam3 is composed of two subprojects: **Rcam3Controller** and **Rcam3Visualizer**. The Controller is an iPhone app that captures the scene using the iPhone's camera (color and depth) and transmits it to the Visualizer, which runs on a host machine (PC or Mac). The Visualizer renders the scene with several visual effects.

Rcam3 was featured in [Masaya Matsuura]'s live concert on December 22, 2024.
